Installation
---

### Installing system-wide the `kloud` command

While installing system-wide, you will need administrator privilleges to install the command inside `/usr/local/bin/` directory.

```
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/kloud https://github.com/kiboko-labs/docker-images/releases/download/1.0.2/kloud.phar
sudo curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/kloud.pubkey https://github.com/kiboko-labs/docker-images/releases/download/1.0.2/kloud.phar.pubkey
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kloud
```

### Installing the Phar package in your project

While installing in your project, no administrator privilege is required, the phar package will be available in the `bin/` directory.

```
curl -L -o bin/kloud.phar https://github.com/kiboko-labs/docker-images/releases/download/1.0.2/kloud.phar
curl -L -o bin/kloud.phar.pubkey https://github.com/kiboko-labs/docker-images/releases/download/1.0.2/kloud.phar.pubkey
chmod +x bin/kloud.phar
```

We also recommend to add both files to your `.gitignore` file.

### If you want to use the pre-packaged docker image

If you do not want to install the command on your machine, a Docker image is ready for one-shot usages and can be executed this way:

```
docker run --rm -ti -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v $HOME/.docker:/opt/docker/.docker \
    -v $PWD:/app \
    kiboko/kloud <command>
```

### Update your stack

You can invoke the following command that will guess what services needs to be updated and in case of differences, a wizard will ask you what you wish to keep or delete:
